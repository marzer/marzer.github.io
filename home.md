So yeah. This is all pretty new. Not much to see here yet.

I guess there will be a blog summary at some point, when I can be bothered doing the webdev bits.

## Things I've made:

-   [toml++] - TOML parser and serializer for C++17
-   [poxy] - a documentation generator for C++
-   A number of small, self-contained single-header libs:
    -   [mz::spin_mutex] - an atomic spin-lock-based `std::mutex` alternative
    -   [mz::tagged_ptr] - a [Tagged Pointer] type
    -   [mz::type_list] - a variadic 'type list' to replace std::tuple in metaprogramming contexts
-   ...this website I guess?
